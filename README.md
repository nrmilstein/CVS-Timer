# CVS-Timer

CVS Timer is a simple Mac OS X status bar app that helps prevent eye strain, or [Computer Vision Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision_syndrome) (CVS). The app periodically displays a notification reminding the user to take a break from staring at the computer screen.

CVS Timer resides in a "C" icon on the status bar. The time between breaks and break duration can be set by clicking the icon and selecting "Preferences."

CVS Timer was inspired by [AntiRSI](http://antirsi.onnlucky.com/), an app designed to prevent Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). I wanted a simpler app tailored more for eye strain (one that doesn't reset when it detects no mouse/keyboard use), so I created this one.

I have included a compiled .app in the repo for convenience, or you can open it yourself in XCode.
