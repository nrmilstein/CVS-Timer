# CVS-Timer

CVS Timer is a simple Mac OS X status bar app that helps you avoid eye strain from staring at the computer too long, or [Computer Vision Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision_syndrome) (CVS). The app notifies you periodically to take a break from staring at your computer screen.

The app resides in a "C" icon on the status bar. You can set the time between breaks or duration of a break by clicking the icon and going to "Preferences."


CVS Timer was inspired by [AntiRSI](http://antirsi.onnlucky.com/), an app designed to prevent Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). I wanted a simpler app tailored more for eye strain (one that doesn't reset when it detects you're not using the mouse/keyboard), so I created this one.

I have included a compiled .app in the repo for convenience, or you can open it yourself in XCode.
